## Reporting a Vulnerability
Hello and welcome. You are probably looking to report a security bug. \
This is how you do it.
# Getting the information about the error (If Possible)
## INFORMATION
So when you have a error popup (Image in Attachments) You click "Copy Error" \
"Copy Metadata" is the top part of the error which will not help us to fix the error much \
You must include the error If the program is showing you. Since It helps us alot. \
(and the info popup At the end of export If shown)
## What If It doesn't?
Sometimes It's not a error but a segmentation fault or any other bug which is bad for security \
In this case we recommend you send the Dump of the crash (Memory dump)\
If You know much yourself about programming in general you can send us (non-malicious) files or info about the crash \
However no executable
# IMPORTANT
In every report you should include "What you did to make it happen" "How you got it" and "What you guess must have happened"
