# FileConverter
This project was initially made for converting all kinds of file types to another (videos, images, 3D Models, etc...) \
However since It is too hard to me (Atleast right now) I have only implemented some picture types to the other
- Well How does it work?
- - It uses the "CImage" library for processing images
- - Uses WxWidgets for displaying GUI's
- - (Does not have thread support right now. So it may hang a little bit)
